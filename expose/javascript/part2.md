1. Line 12 will print out the current index of prices that the loop is accessing.
2. Line 13 will print out the discounted price for the item at the specified index.
3. Line 14 will print out the rounded version of the price after the discount has been applied.
4. The code will return the array of prices of all items after the discount has been applied.
5. The code would return an error because finalPrice would throw an exception about it not being defined.
6. The code would return an error because finalPrice would throw an exception about it not being defined.
7. The code would return an error because finalPrice would throw an exception about it not being defined.
8. The code would return an error because finalPrice would throw an exception about it not being defined.
9. Line 11 would return an error because the for loop is trying to change the value of a const variable.
10. Line 11 would return an error because the for loop is trying to change the value of a const variable.
11. Line 11 would return an error because the for loop is trying to change the value of a const variable.
12. Given the above Object, write the notation for: 
    1.  student.name
    2.  student["Grad Year"]
    3.  student.greeting
    4.  student{"Favorite Teacher"}.name
    5.  student.courseload[0]
13. Arithmetic
    1.   32 because 3 is a character and that typecasts the 2 from integer into a character and appends them
    2.   1 because the operator is subtraction, so the character is typecasted into int.
    3.   3 is printed because null is worth nothing, which is also worth 0, so 3 + 0 is 3.
    4.   3null is printed because the null is directly casted into a string because the '3' is a string.
    5.   4 is printed because true is worth 1, and adding 3 gives 4.
    6.   0 is printed because false is worth 0, and null is also worth 0, and 0 + 0 is 0.
    7.   3undefined is printed because since the operator is addition, the understand is typecasted into a string, so is appended to 3.
    8.   NaN is printed because the undefined isn't assigned a value and it can't be typecasted, so nothing would be available.
14. Comparison
    1.  true would be printed because 2 is typcasted into an integer and 2 > 1.
    2.  false because the two strings are compared in order, and 2 is not less than 1.
    3.  true because the string is typecasted into an integer, and 2 is same as 2
    4.  false because triple equals are a strict comparison, and 2 and '2' are not the same data type, so false
    5.  false because true is the same as 1, and 1 is not the same as 2
    6.  true because Boolean(2) returns true, and true is the same as true.
15. == is a regular comparison and === is a strict comparison. == does not take into account data type, but === does.

17. The result would be the original array but each value multiplied by two. In each for loop iteration, the index is multiplied by two by calling the callback function.

19. 1 4 3 2 is the output
